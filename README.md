# Limnus

Limnus is a foundational game engine framework designed to serve as a robust platform for building custom game engines. Rather than being a standalone engine, it provides the essential building blocks and architecture that game engine developers need.

## Overview

**Limnus** offers a modular, extensible architecture that handles core game engine concerns such as:
- Resource management
- Platform abstraction
- Message systems
- Asset handling
- Audio systems
- Input processing
- Rendering abstractions

## Related Projects

If you're looking for a complete game engine solution, consider these projects built on Limnus:

### [Swamp Engine](https://github.com/swamp/swamp)
A full-featured 2D game engine that leverages Limnus's architecture to provide an optimized development experience for 2D games.

### [Mangrove Engine](https://github.com/swamp/mangrove)
A 2D game engine with integrated scripting capabilities, built on the Limnus Engine (and in turn Limnus) framework. Ideal for developers who want the power of a custom engine with the flexibility of scripted gameplay logic.

## Architecture

**Limnus** is built with modularity in mind, allowing engine developers to:
- Pick and choose components they need
- Extend existing functionality
- Replace modules with custom implementations

## Target Audience

**Limnus** is designed for:
- Game engine developers
- Teams building custom engine solutions
- Developers who need fine-grained control over their engine architecture

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
limnus = "0.0.10"
```
