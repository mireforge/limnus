# limnus-macros  ðŸ§±

`limnus-macros` is a procedural macro crate designed to simplify the implementation of common traits for limnus-resource type 
in Rust applications. It provides a convenient way to derive the `Resource` trait for your types.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Derive Macro**: Automatically implement the `Resource` trait for your structs.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that only types marked as resources can be stored and managed by limnus-resource.
- **Ease of Use**: Reduce boilerplate code when implementing traits for multiple types.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To use `limnus-macros`, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:
