Limnus WGPU Window is a Rust crate that provides a simple and efficient abstraction for creating 
and managing a window with rendering surfaces using winit and wgpu. It streamlines the setup
of the wgpu device, queue, and surface, handling window resizing and rendering, making it easier 
to build high-performance graphics applications.

## âœ¨ Features

- Easy Window and Surface Management: Simplifies the creation and configuration of windows and wgpu surfaces using winit.
- Device and Queue Setup: Automatically initializes the wgpu device and queue with sensible defaults.
- Responsive Resizing: Handles window resizing events and reconfigures the rendering surface accordingly.
- Flexible Rendering Pipeline: Provides a render function callback to integrate custom rendering logic seamlessly.
- Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with major operating systems supported by winit and wgpu.
